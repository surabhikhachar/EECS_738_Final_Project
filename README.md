# EECS_738_Final_Project

This is the final project for EECS 738, Machine Learning. The contributors are Bisher Anadani, Will Duncan, Surabhi Khachar, Andre Kurait, and Vivek Tallavajhala. This project looks at collegiate level basketball datasets and attempts to create game-outcome prediction models using various machine learning algorithms. These algorithms/models were either built from scratch or utilized existing python libraries.

## Project code

Most of the code exists on Jupyter notebooks as they provided a streamlined medium to work with pandas. There is also some Python code, all of which can be found in the 'Notebooks' folder. All the CSV data and output bracket prediction exists in the 'Data' folder.

### Installation

To run the python code, simply download the zip file of this project. The notebooks have embedded outputs of the code that was run previously on kernels.

### Models

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Data

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Results

Explain what these tests test and why
